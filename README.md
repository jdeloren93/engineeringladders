# Introduction

This framework seeks to provide software engineering leaders tools to engage in meaningful conversations regarding the expectations of each of the "core 4" positions in Product Engineering teams. Ideally, this will allow leaders to assist their employees in planning for the next rung of their career ladder.

The framework uses roles and levels that are somewhat standard in the US tech industry, and has been adapted from @jorgef's original to be tailored specifically to Optum // UHC Technology. Please use the information provided as a baseline and work with your employees to refine as needed.

The framework relies heavily on radar charts to visualize the different perspectives and expectations of a given position:

# Career Ladders

The framework has 4 different "ladders":

* [**Software Engineer**](Engineer.md): or "SWE," requires a deep level of technical expertise. This is your baseline "Individual Contributor" role.
* [**Lead Software Engineer**](LeadEngineer.md): or "Lead SWE." This role is also known across the industry as a "Tech Lead," or "Dev Lead." The Lead Engineer is the owner of the system (the solution that best achieves a Product's OKRs). This role requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support. At Optum, years of experience in this role leads to the "Principal" and "Senior Principal" title designations. See XX-PRINCIPAL-XX for detail on how those roles differ/expand over time.
* [**Technical Product Manager**](TechnicalProductManager.md): or "TPM, "this role is responsible for the coordination of the backlog, and overall development activity, for initiatives that extend across multiple teams, or involve vast organizational change/engagement. This role does not emerge organically for 100% of Product Engineering teams, but should be in place for large-scale products that are embedded deeply within a hairball of technical dependencies (think Price Transparency). This role may also be needed within products that struggle from a lack of strong Product Ownership on the business side.
* [**Engineering Manager**](EngineeringManager.md): or "EM." This role is responsible for the consistent delivery, career growth and level of happiness of the team. While the Lead Engineer owns the solution, the EM owns the **successful delivery** of that solution.

If you are confused about the difference between a [Tech Lead](TechLead.md) and an [Engineering Manager](EngineeringManager.md), please refer to the [Tech Lead vs Engineering Manager](TechLead-EngineeringManager.md) page for a detailed comparison.

# Axes

The chart shown above has the following 5 axes:
* **Technology**: level of knowledge of the tech stack and tools used to build the solution, as well as overall engineering knowledge, including modern technologies
* **System**: level of ownership of the system(s), or overall solution
* **People**: level of engagement with the individuals on each team(s)
* **Process**: level of engagement with the processes in place to ensure delivery
* **Influence**: level of influence within the organization and/or industry (akin to Blast Radius in a sense - Link to leveling guide)

The **influence** axis can be seen as a *different dimension* since it is orthogonal and applies to all the other axes.

Each axis has 5 different levels of performance. It is important to highlight that every level includes the previous one(s). For example, someone that *evangelizes* technology, *specializes* and *adopts* it as well.

Keep reading to better understand each level.

# Levels

## Technology

1. **Adopts**: actively learns and adopts the technology and tools defined by the team
2. **Specializes**: is the go-to person for one or more technologies and takes initiative to learn new ones
3. **Evangelizes**: researches, creates proofs of concept and introduces new technologies to the team
4. **Masters**: has very deep knowledge about the whole technology stack of the system
5. **Creates**: designs and creates new technologies that are widely used either by internal or external teams

## System

1. **Enhances**: successfully pushes new features and bug fixes to improve and extend the system
2. **Designs**: designs and implements medium to large size features while reducing the system's tech debt
3. **Owns**: owns the production operation and monitoring of the system and is aware of its SLAs
4. **Evolves**: evolves the architecture to support future requirements and defines its SLAs
5. **Leads**: leads the technical excellence of the system and creates plans to mitigate outages

## People

1. **Learns**: quickly learns from others and consistently steps up when it is required

# FAQs

**What if some of the people don't meet all the points?**

That is very normal, people are usually stronger in some areas and weaker in others. The framework should not be used as a checklist to promote people but instead as guidance to have meaningful career conversations.

**What if my organization's career ladder is different?**

Since the framework is open source, you have the opportunity to adapt it to your organization. Feel free to use the [chart template](charts/template.png) to define your own levels.

**When is a person ready to move to the next level?**

Companies usually expect a person to be performing at the next level *consistently for several months* before formalizing a promotion.

**How do I collect evidence to support the discussion with my direct reports?**

Different teams collect evidence in different ways. A recommended approach is to use a combination of:
* 1:1 conversations
* Feedback from peers and other teams
* Self-evaluation

**Could the framework provide more specific examples of behavior to support each level?**

Specific examples of behavior require knowledge about the way that the team works, the system architecture and its technology stack. It is recommended to allow each team to define their own examples.

**Why does the framework stop at level 7?**

Levels 8 and above vary drastically from company to company. Organizations of different sizes tend to assign a diverse level of scope to positions so high in their structure.

**Do you have any additional resources about the topic?**

* [The Manager's Path](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920056843.do): Camille Fournier does an excellent job at describing the expectations and challenges of many engineering positions. Also, she provides good advice about writing a career ladder in chapter 9.

* [How to Be Good at Performance Appraisals](https://store.hbr.org/product/how-to-be-good-at-performance-appraisals-simple-effective-done-right/10295): Dick Grote explains in simple terms how to define job responsibilities and how to evaluate performance (results and behaviors).
